# Simple Ardumower_PCBs

# Simple MainPCB only for Arduino DUE or Grand Central

New Board Design. All Pins from Software are now on the PCB. 
Supports 4 Motor Driver for Mowing.
Only a few Electronic Parts are needed. 
- JST-XH Connectors
- Screw Terminal 5.04mm
- Resistors
- Pin Header Connector 2.54mm
- Active Buzzer
- LED
- Jumper

Tested with MC33926 motor driver. Brushless Motordriver did not work at the Moment with Azuritber.


# Power PCB for Simple MainPCB
# Attention: Charging Board need some Improvements and did not work at the Moment

The charging board and the power supply for the motors are on a separate board.

Should also fit into small housings.

Use it at your own Risk.
